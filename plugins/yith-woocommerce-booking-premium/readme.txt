= Notes =

    - class names:
        classes that handles CPT are called YITH_WCBK_Obj_Post_Type_Admin (example YITH_WCBK_Booking_Post_Type_Admin)
        classes that handles taxonomies are called YITH_WCBK_Obj_Tax_Admin (example YITH_WCBK_Service_Tax_Admin)
        classes that allows to handle (get, set, search, etc...) something, such as CPT, are the Helpers (examples: YITH_WCBK_Service_Helper, YITH_WCBK_Person_Type_Helper, YITH_WCBK_Date_Helper )
    - on backend the Booking (and the Booking menu) is handled by the class includes/booking/class.yith-wcbk-booking-admin.php
        it calls:
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-calendar.php           -> handle the Calendar on backend
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-create.php             -> handle the booking creation on backend
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-metabox.php            -> handle booking metaboxes
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-post-type-helper.php   -> is the Helper of Booking Post Type
    - difference between templates (frontend, so they can be overridden by the theme) and views (backend, so they cannot be overridden)
    - the AJAX calls are fully handled by the YITH_WCBK_Ajax class

    [Italian]

    - nomenclatura classi:
            le classi che gestiscono i CPT si chiamano YITH_WCBK_Obj_Post_Type_Admin (esempio YITH_WCBK_Booking_Post_Type_Admin)
            le classi che gestiscono le tassonomie si chiamano YITH_WCBK_Obj_Tax_Admin (esempio YITH_WCBK_Service_Tax_Admin)
            le classi che permettono di gestire (get, set, search, etc...) qualcosa, come CPT, sono gli Helper (esempi: YITH_WCBK_Service_Helper, YITH_WCBK_Person_Type_Helper, YITH_WCBK_Date_Helper )
    - il booking sul backend (e il menu Booking) viene gestito dalla classe includes/booking/class.yith-wcbk-booking-admin.php
        essa richiama:
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-calendar.php           -> gestisce il calendario a backend
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-create.php             -> gestisce la creazione del booking a backend
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-metabox.php            -> gestisce le metabox del booking
          includes/booking/admin/class.yith-wcbk-booking-post-type-helper.php   -> gestisce il post type del booking
    - differenza tra templates (frontend e quindi sovrascrivibili dal tema) e views (admin e quindi NON sovrascrivibili)
    - la parte AJAX viene gestita interamente dalla classe YITH_WCBK_Ajax
